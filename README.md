### Introduction

Magic The Gathering (MTG, or just Magic) is a trading card game first published in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast. This game has seen immense popularity and new cards are still released every few months. The strength of different cards in the game can vary wildly and as a result some cards now sell on secondary markets for as high as thousands of dollars.

MTG JSON has an excellent collection of every single Magic Card - stored in JSON data. Version 3.6 (collected September 21, 2016) of their database is provided here.

Full documentation for the data is provided here ðŸ‘‰ **http://mtgjson.com/documentation.html**

Also, if you want to include images of the cards in your writeups, you can grab them from the official Wizards of the Coast website using the following URL:

**http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=180607&type=card**

Just replace the multiverse ID with the one provided in the mtgjson file.

### Requirements

The purpose of this challenge is to create an API able to provide information about Magic The Gathering cards. All card informaton is stored in a S3-like bucket with a big json file: `AllPrintings.json`.

We provide you with a MinIO docker container. [MinIO](https://docs.min.io/docs/) is a drop-in replacement of S3 that is used like if you were interacting with a real S3 bucket. This means that in order to setup a MinIO client (which is compatible with standard S3 clients) you can use `root` as `AWS_KEY` and `1234Abcd` as `AWS_SECRET_KEY`.

The main points you will have to do are the following

1. Import all the data in the bucket provided **in the most efficient and performant way possible**, ready to be served by an API. Consider the data to be **remote**. You cannot import the data by directly reading the file as if it was located in your local hard drive. 
2. Create an endpoint to be able to retrieve the full collection of cards.
3. Create an endpoint to be able to retrieve a single card by ID.
4. Create an endpoint to be able to update a single card by ID.
5. Update the endpoint of the cards collection to be able to perform a text search. (Optional)
6. Create a GraphQL endpoint. (Optional)

The technology used preferably should be PHP, and you can use the libraries or frameworks that you want. Feel free to do any design considerations that you want or need. And keep in mind that we're seeking an MVP in order to test how would that work, if that helps you get context.

#### How to use this repo?

In order for this repo to work, you will need to have **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)** and **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)** installed.

1. Clone this repo into your computer
2. Run `docker compose up -d`
3. Now you're ready to browse the MinIO buckets at `http://127.0.0.1:9090/`. It also can be used as a standard S3-like endpoint.

#### What will be assessed?

1. Clean, simple and easy-to-understand code.
2. Time-to-market is a top priority. This means the we value more than everything a simple solution and especially **easy to maintain**
3. Performance & efficiency. Note: It does not work a solution that has a really good performance but it's hard to maintain and no other in the team can touch it.
